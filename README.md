# Global family planning unmet needs

## Introduction

This project was intiated to spike out using [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to create an attractive frontend architecture that allows users to visualise data in an engaging way.

The topic idea came form searching for open data sets, and coming across those provided by the WHO. I have always had an interest in maternal and reproductive health, in pariticular, access tor eproductive care, to decided to utilize the "Family planning needs satisfied" data set found [here](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.FAMILYPLANNINGREGv?lang=en).
