# Data visualisation project

## Introduction

This project was intitially started to spike out using [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/), Chakra UI and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to create an attractive frontend architecture that allows users to visualise data in an engaging way.

The topic ideas came form searching for open data sets, and thinking about how they could be displayed.
